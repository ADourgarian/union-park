# Union Park
## Description 
This the capstone group project my team and I were assigned at Prime Digital Academy. Our goal was to create an app that pulled from google's calendar API and stored tags for the events pulled on the backend. On the front end, it pulled the data and formatted it into a user friendly table with search functionality via the tags.
